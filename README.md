# MIRcat: Minimum Information Requirement Catalogue

MIRCat is the Minimum Information Requirement Catalogue, which includes representations of Minimum Information Checklists or Reporting Guidelines in a machine-actionable way, relying on [JSON-schemas](https://json-schema.org/) that enable to produce and validate [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) data conformant with the checklists. 

For each reporting guideline, we produced a Machine-Actionable Metadata Model represented in JSON-schemas and a set of JSON-LD context files that provide the semantic context.

The representation for each of the following reporting guidelines can be accessed through persistent identifiers using the w3id service.

- Minimum Information About a Cellular Assay ([MIACA](http://w3id.org/mircat/miaca/))
- Minimum Information About Cell Migration Assays ([MIACME](http://w3id.org/mircat/miacme/))
- Minimum Information about Flow Cytometry ([MiFlowCyt](http://w3id.org/mircat/miflowcyt/))
