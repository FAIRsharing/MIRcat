## Model based on MIACA and MIACME

The JSON-schema-based metadata model provide here allows you to report datasets that comply with the two reporting guidelines MIACA and MIACME.

This metadata model was automatically produced by the [jsonldschema]() python-based tool, by 'merging' the MIACA and MIACME JSON-schema-based models.
